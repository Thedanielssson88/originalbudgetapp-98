Let me check what user I'm actually authenticated as in the browser and compare it to what the server sees:

  Bash(curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/auth/user | jq '.')
  ‚éø  {                               
       "message": "Not authenticated"
     }

‚óè Ah! I'm not authenticated at all when using curl. But the app is working, which means the browser session is authenticated as dev-user-123. Let me check the database with the correct
  userId filter:

‚óè Bash(NODE_ENV=development DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_csIURKah4TN5@ep-soft-salad-aeyhh2aj.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require" psql $D‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø                    id                  |    name    | last_update 
     --------------------------------------+------------+-------------
      5303e234-112a-422b-91e3-07de66030b81 | √ñverf√∂ring |
     ‚Ä¶ +1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Wait, that's still only 1 account. But the server shows 9 accounts for dev-user-123. Let me check all accounts in the dev database to see what user_ids exist:

‚óè Bash(NODE_ENV=development DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_csIURKah4TN5@ep-soft-salad-aeyhh2aj.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require" psql $D‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø                    id                  |    name    |   user_id    | last_update 
     --------------------------------------+------------+--------------+-------------
      5303e234-112a-422b-91e3-07de66030b81 | √ñverf√∂ring | dev-user-123 |
     ‚Ä¶ +1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè This confirms your point but also shows we still have the database routing issue. The server logs show it's finding 11 accounts total, but we only see 1 in the database.

  However, you're absolutely right about the authentication issue. Let me check the browser console to see what's happening with the accounts data. But first, let me look at the recent
  server logs to see exactly what's happening:

‚óè BashOutput(Reading shell output)
  ‚éø  üîç [MIDDLEWARE DEBUG] Session ID: znBz_kgrFBbzjp9ejxSe1t1hk3Eusw6R
     üîç [MIDDLEWARE DEBUG] Session data: {
       "cookie": {
     ‚Ä¶ +804 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Perfect! The server logs show THE ACCOUNTS API IS WORKING CORRECTLY and Sparande and Semester DO HAVE lastUpdate timestamps:

  - Sparande: lastUpdate: 2025-08-16T13:24:58.314Z
  - Semester: lastUpdate: 2025-08-16T13:27:19.247Z

  But the UI still shows "Senast uppdaterad: Aldrig". This is definitely a UI cache issue.

  Now open the browser and check the console for:
  1. The accounts debug logging I added
  2. The cache invalidation logs when you upload a file
